# Chrome Extension Boilerplate

This boilerplate provides a solid starting point for developing Chrome extensions with modern web technologies and tools. It integrates a variety of features to make development smoother and more efficient.

## Features

- **Messaging RPC**: Facilitates communication between different parts of the extension.
- **Popup/Content API**: Enables interaction between the popup and content scripts.
- **React 18**: Utilizes the latest React for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript support with proper type checking.
- **SCSS/Sass**: Advanced styling with variables, nesting, and more.
- **Webpack 5**: Bundles assets, scripts, and styles with optimization.
- **Babel 7**: Transpiles modern JavaScript to ensure browser compatibility.
- **Hot Reloading**: Speeds up development with live content updates.
- **ESLint**: Maintains code quality with comprehensive linting rules.
- **Prettier**: Automatically formats code for consistency.
- **Chrome Storage API Utilities**: Simple Promise-based utilities for storage operations.
- **Optimized Production Build**: Code splitting and minification for production.
- **Chuck Norris Jokes**: Integration with chucknorris-io API.
- **One-liner Jokes**: Integration with one-liner-joke package.

## Getting Started

To get started with this boilerplate, clone the repository to your local machine and install the dependencies.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chrome-extension-boilerplate.git
cd chrome-extension-boilerplate
```

2. **Install the dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

or with yarn:

```bash
yarn
```

### Development

To start developing your Chrome extension with hot reloading, use:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or with yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start webpack in watch mode, which will automatically rebuild the extension when you make changes.

### Type Checking

To run TypeScript type checking, use:

```bash
npm run type-check
```

or with yarn:

```bash
yarn type-check
```

### Linting

To lint your code, use:

```bash
npm run lint
```

or with yarn:

```bash
yarn lint
```

To automatically fix linting issues, use:

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

or with yarn:

```bash
yarn lint:fix
```

### Building

For a production build of your extension, use:

```bash
npm run build
```

or with yarn:

```bash
yarn build
```

This will create an optimized production build in the `dist` folder.

### Loading the Extension into Chrome

After building your extension, you can load it into Chrome to test it:

1. Open Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions/.
2. Enable "Developer mode" at the top right.
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the dist folder generated by the build process.

Your extension is now loaded and ready for use.

## Extension API

### RPC System

The RPC (Remote Procedure Call) system allows communication between different parts of the extension:

```typescript
// In background.js
import RPC from '../lib/rpc';

const rpc = new RPC();
rpc.registerMethod('myMethod', async (param) => {
  // Implement your method logic
  return result;
});

// In popup or content script
import api from '../lib/api';

const result = await api.myMethod(param);
```

### Storage Utilities

The storage utilities provide a simple interface to Chrome's storage API:

```typescript
import { syncStorage, localStorage, sessionStorage } from '../lib/storage';

// Store data
await syncStorage.set('key', value);

// Retrieve data
const value = await syncStorage.get('key');

// Remove data
await syncStorage.remove('key');
```

## Included Libraries

- **chucknorris-io**: API client for Chuck Norris jokes
- **one-liner-joke**: Generate random one-liner jokes
- **React & React DOM**: UI library for building the popup interface
